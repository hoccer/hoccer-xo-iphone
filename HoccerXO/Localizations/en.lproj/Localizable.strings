//==============================================================================
// Pluralocalization:
//
// Application texts containing numeric values may require inflection of nouns
// and/or grammar changes. Hoccer XO automatically appends a plural category to
// these localization keys depending on the current numeric value and locale.
//
// Plural Categories:
//
// - zero
// - one   (singular)
// - two   (dual)
// - few   (paucal)
// - many
// - other (general plural form, no suffix)
//
// Example:
//
// "message_count"       = "%d Nachrichten";
// "message_count (one)" = "%d Nachricht"; // ... or even "Eine Nachricht"
//
// That's enough for german, but arabic or russian translators have to provide
// forms for other categories.
