Problem:
The application settings and the profile table view are basically identical. They both
present a table view with the same look. They also have very similar table cells. There
is no way to share table cell prototypes in one storyboard between different scenes.

Solution:
We load the table view cell prototypes from separate NIBs and share them in two different
tables. This is better than to duplicate the table cell prototypes in the storyboard, because
it avoids inconsistencies.
